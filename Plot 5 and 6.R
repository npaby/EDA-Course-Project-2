##Question #5 and #6: How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City? Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
